# Transaction History

The Android Burstcoin Wallet Application offers you a history of the last 15 transactions recorded for an account. A List containing ingoing and outgoing transactions with their according amounts. Ingoing transactions state the sender's addresses and outgoing transactions state the recipient's addresses. In addition, the exact dates are displayed, when transactions were executed.

## Unconfirmed Transactions

The history also shows unconfirmed transactions, which are currently being processed. Unconfirmed transactions are indicated by a blue refresh sign instead of a green check mark on the right side.

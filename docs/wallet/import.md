# Import existing Wallet

The Android Burstcoin Wallet Application offers the possibility to import existing wallets. You can either import an active wallet or an offline wallet.

## Active Wallet

An active wallet offers full functionality. You can check your balance and transactions. In addition, you can send Burstcoins to other addresses. In order to use an active wallet you need to be in possession of the corresponding passphrase.

An active wallet can be imported with two easy steps:

1. Enter the passphrase of the wallet
2. Enter a PIN code to secure the wallet

## Offline Wallet

An offline wallet offers the same functionality than an active wallet. Except you cannot send Burstcoins to other addresses. An offline wallet does not need a passphrase, because it only serves as a possibility to watch current activities on a specific wallet. You can even add addresses that aren't yours. This is possible through the transparency of the Burstcoin blockchain.

One easy step to import an offline wallet:

1. Enter the Burst address of the wallet

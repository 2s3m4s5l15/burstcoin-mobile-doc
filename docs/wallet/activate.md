# Active an offline Wallet

Already imported offline wallets can be activated to gain full functionality.

By entering the passphrase which corresponds to the Burst address and a PIN code to secure the wallet, it is possible to activate the wallet in order to send Burstcoins to other addresses. Just tap on the Activate button in the balance view of the selected offline wallet.
